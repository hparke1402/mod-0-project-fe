## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  1.  It really resonated with me when Carmen Popoviciu talked about tracking your own progress when you are trying to learn something new and not comparing yourself to others and their progress. I have already found myself feeling “behind” when I am struggling in Mod 0 classes to understand a concept when it seems like the people I’m working with already seem to have grasped it.

  2. Pay attention to how you view yourself when you are trying to learn/overcome something and if you’re actually viewing yourself and your progress through the lens of a Growth Mindset or not. A Growth Mindset is not something you “have”, it’s something that needs to be tended to consistently and developed over time. You can have a Growth Mindset in one area of your life but not in another and it’s good to take stock and check in with yourself often to evaluate how your mindset could be impacting your learning/growing process.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  1. I think having the confidence to apply to Turing shows a Growth Mindset- having limited computer/tech experience, it seemed silly at first to pursue a career in technology as I thought technology just “wasn’t” for me. To combat this, I explored a lot of resources and gave myself a chance to engage with and understand the concepts I was trying to learn. I was somewhat shocked when it made sense to me and I was enjoying the learning process. Once I got to that point, I knew I had to keep that attitude and pause from time to time to reflect how far I’ve come and trust that the things that are hard now won’t always be.

  2. About a year ago, I had the first of two surgeries to correct some major structural issues with my foot that I couldn’t put off any longer. I went from being super active to being basically bed-ridden for 3 months in excruciating pain. When I could finally start walking again, it was obvious there was something wrong and I had to go back for a revision 6 months after the first surgery. The complications and stress has led to a full year of experiencing chronic pain and a massive loss of physical ability and mobility. My biggest struggle has been staying positive and adopting a Growth Mindset by telling myself I will eventually not feel pain everyday and be able to be as active as I want to be again someday with some effort and patience. For most of the year, it’s felt like my condition will never improve to where I want it to be and I’ve definitely found myself stuck in a Fixed Mindset about my ability to get better, which ultimately has done nothing to move forward.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

* It definitely has made some parts of the project take longer than expected as I had to go back and find exactly where in the book, class slides, lectures, online resource etc. I could find the answer to something. It was mostly frustrating because I could recall most of what I was meant to do and why but there would be some small but crucial detail I just wasn’t sure about that would slow my progress. Ultimately it’s helping me understand what resources to draw on if I’m stuck and is making processes (like the Git workflow) more intuitive and concrete in my mind.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

* Conditional statements can help programmers account for multiple possible inputs or scenarios, ensuring that the code will continue running regardless of the input. Using if/else if/else statements, we can create a script or outcome for each scenario that will run when it’s proven true after being compared to the defined condition. Once a condition is found to be true and executes, it moves on, ignoring all other code.   

* A daily life conditional is if I will walk to do my errands: If it takes less than 30 mins to walk to my destination, I will walk. If it takes me 30 mins or longer to walk to my destination, I will drive.

* I use the Tasks feature on Google calendar and once I add a task to the list, it creates a circle next to it that can be “checked off” once completed. If the box is unchecked, it stays in the to-do section. If the box is checked, it will move the task into the “completed” section.


5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

* You can add multiple conditions to a statement by using `if/else if/else` statements to define multiple conditions. The code will run the `if` statement first against a previously defined variable/condition and if found to be true, the computer will execute that line of code and move on. If the `if` statement is found to be false, the computer will ignore it and continue down the list of remaining `else if/else` statements, evaluating each one in order until one is found to meet the conditions and execute the script. Only one `if/else if/else` statement needs to satisfy the condition for the program to disregard the rest of the conditions and continue on with the next task/code block .     


6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

* Using the logical AND `&&` operator will evaluate each operand and tell us if the condition is met for both. It will return “false” if one of the two does not meet the condition.

* Using the logical OR `||` operator will evaluate each operand and tell us if either of them meets the condition. If just one of the two meets the condition, this operator will return “true”.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

* Is there a limit to how many conditions you can add in the form of ‘if/else if/else’ statements?
