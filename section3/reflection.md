## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
  - This section still took a bit of time but I found that I was finding answers/helpful resources much quicker this time around.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  - Developers probably use arrays to store the "list" of my subscriptions on YouTube. My Subscriptions folder holds multiple elements (each channel) of related values.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  - An Array method is a specific function that helps us perform an operation on an array and its elements (such as the pop, push shift, and unshift methods.)

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  - Loops help developers execute the same code multiple times on a data set without having to write redundant code for each operation. Using a loop in conjunction with an array would be helpful when we want to run or "loop" each individual element in an array through the same code to be evaluated.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  - To a 5 year old, I would explain that loops helps us understand what characteristics their dolls have: in an "array" of 10 baby dolls, only 5 have blonde hair. Instead of going through each item one at a time to see which ones and how many total out of 10 have blonde hair, a computer could help us by making a loop that will look at all of them at once and determine which ones have blonde hair and report back the answer to us.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
  - Is there any type of data/data set that cannot be stored in an array?
