In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated

Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete
any remaining prompt.

//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
//console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
var numAnimals;
numAnimals = animals.length;
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
console.log(animals.fill("Gorilla", 2));

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
console.log(animals.push("Cheetah"));

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
console.log(animals[2]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var listOfFoods = ["potato", "cheese", "crackers", "carrot", "applesauce"]

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
var numFoods;
numFoods = listOfFoods.length;
console.log(numFoods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
console.log(listOfFoods.unshift("broccoli"));
console.log(listOfFoods);


// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
console.log(listOfFoods.pop());
console.log(listOfFoods);


// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
console.log(listOfFoods.push("watermelon", "popcorn", "apple"));
console.log(listOfFoods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
console.log(listOfFoods.shift());
console.log(listOfFoods);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: YouTube- Keeps all my "Liked" videos in a separate playlist.
// 2: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp- This site has lists on lists on lists!
// It has a menu along the left side of the screen displaying lists such as "Js Syntax" and "Array Methods"
// containing helpful information for each category.
// 3: Slack has a menu on the left with different catergories containing lists such as "Starred"
// which displays all of the channels I have starred.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of the project
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// This line of code is creating a conditional statement and when run, and the condition
//(the code within the parentheses) is evaluated for truth. This line is asking if
//the value of the percentBatteryLeft variable is less than or equal to 15.
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
// This line will execute the script (in parentheses) if the above condition is found to be true.
  console.log("Can call Uber");
}
//This line of code will only run if the above condition is false. It defines another condition
//which will be evaluated for truth, in this case if the percentBatteryLeft variable has a
//value less than 15.
else if (percentBatteryLeft < 15) {
//This line of code contains the script that will run if this condition is found to be true.
  console.log("Cannot call Uber");
}
//This line creates a logical AND conditional statement that is evaluating if both the values
//of the hasCharger and chargerType are true.
if (hasCharger && chargerType) {
//If above condition results in both variable values being evaluated as true, the script below
//will run.
  console.log("Can call Uber");
}
//This line of code contains script that will run if above condition is found to be false.
else {
  console.log("Cannot call Uber");
}
// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
